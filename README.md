# Gharbi Bold
Gharbi Bold is an open-source font crafted specifically for Arabic, Kurdish, and Persian titling.

Unlike many similar fonts that often bear the "Kufi" label, Gharbi was named to reflect the influence of modern Western typestyles and symbolizes the fusion of the two script styles.

Designed with simplicity in mind, Gharbi Bold gracefully diverges from the rigid geometric forms typical of Kufic designs, notably in characters like Sahd/Dhahd, Tta/Ttha, medial Heh, and isolated Yeh. Strokes are infused with a subtle softness through the gentle rounding of their endings.
