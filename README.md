# Gharbi Bold
Gharbi Bold is an open-source font crafted specifically for Arabic, Kurdish, and Persian titling.

The font has two levels of geometric compliance with the Kufic standard. In the first level the font appears as strictly geometric. The second stylistic set changes the font to a more fluid interpretation of Kufic.
